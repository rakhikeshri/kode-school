    A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
    arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital
    electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
    programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
    A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the
    hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed
    and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of
    computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network
    or computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and consumer products use
    computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave
    ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like
    industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose
    devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
    Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and
    users.

    Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
    Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
    development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
    text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
    services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development
    commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
    development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server
    and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web
    professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design
    aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development
    may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and
    available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and
    businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
    developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while
    developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single
    permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job
    positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
    development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than
    the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web
    developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
    full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
    and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal
    with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim
    Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has
    boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
    documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by
    technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
    such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
    from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
    describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
    cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML
    pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
    forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
    create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
    as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
    <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags
    such as
    <p>and</p>
    surround and provide information about document text and may include
    sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
    interpret the content of the page.

    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
    the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or
    XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
    cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
    presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
    improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
    specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
    share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
    enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
    pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and
    content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
    styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by
    voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
    tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
    is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
